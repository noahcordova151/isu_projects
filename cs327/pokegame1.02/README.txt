Iteration 3 of the creation of a game based on Pokemon.

This iteration of the game generates the game's world from individual maps that are only generated upon visiting them for the first time.
Users start at the center of the world, map (0,0), and can use specific command line arguments to move to neighboring maps or fly to a specified map. 

The professor's 1.01 solution (previous iteration) was used in its entirety as a basis for this iteration, but all code added on to complete assignment 1.02 is original work.

Makefile works exactly as it does in the professor's assignment 1.01 solution. Run...
    make clean
    make 
    ./poke327
