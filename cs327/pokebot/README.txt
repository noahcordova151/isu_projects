Standalone program to act as an AI chatbot to be implemented into my Pokegame as PokeBot. 

Pokebot takes user input and sends it to OpenAI's API endpoint for ai text completion, similar to ChatGPT, receives the response, and prints it labelled as PokeBot.
This program uses the curl and json-c libraries for http requests and json objects.
