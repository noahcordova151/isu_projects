Program to create a Pokemon-esque game.

This iteration of the game places a pc trainer randomly upon every generated map. 
Then, the program calculates and outputs the travel time of the shortest path to the pc from every location on the map for both hikers and rivals.
This program sufficiently fulfills all the required components and functionalities as described in assignment doc 1.03.

The professor's 1.02 solution was used (almost but not quite completely) as a basis for this iteration, but all code added on to complete assignment 1.03 is original work.

The output to the terminal looks weird because of the terminal size. To see the correct format of the hiker and rival travel time maps, you must copy and paste into any text editor.

Makefile works exactly as it does in the professor's assignment 1.01 solution. Run...
    make clean
    make 
    ./poke327
